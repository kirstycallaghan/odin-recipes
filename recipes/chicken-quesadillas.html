    <h2>Kids love these delicious chicken quesadillas as a quick dinner inbetween school and clubs</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Large flour tortillas</li>
        <li>Grated cheese such as mild or sharp cheddar, or Monterey Jack</li>
        <li>Olive oil or butter</li>
        <li>Sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>Green onions</li>
        <li>Black olives, sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>Chicken pieces</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat a large skillet (cast iron works great) on medium high heat. Add a small amount of oil (about 1/2 teaspoon) and spread it around the bottom of the pan with a spatula (you could use butter as well).</li>
    <li>Take one large flour tortilla and place it in the pan. Flip the tortilla over a few times, 10 seconds between flips. Air pockets should begin to form within the tortilla.</li>
    <li>When pockets of air begin to form, take a handful of grated cheese, sprinkle over the top of the tortilla, making sure that the cheese does not land on the pan itself.</li>
    <li>Add whatever additional ingredients you choose: green onion, sliced mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, etc. If you would like your quesadilla to be a chicken quesadilla, add some diced cooked chicken.</li>
    <li> Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. The pan should be hot enough by now to have plenty of residual heat to melt the cheese and brown the tortilla. If the quesadilla begins to smoke too much, remove from the heat.</li>
    <li>After a minute, check to see if the cheese is melted. If not, return the cover and keep checking every minute until the cheese is melted.</li>
    <li>When the cheese is sufficiently melted, use a spatula to lift up one side of the quesadilla and flip over the other side, as if you were making an omelette.</li>
    <li>Remove quesadilla from pan and cut into wedges.</li>
    <li> Serve with the lettuce, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole.</li>
